# Eat&Greet
Coding Practices:
- Branch before making a change. NEVER edit or make changes on main directly
- Follow the ```merge``` steps within the git repo to merge into main
- Anytime changes are made and merged into main, run ```git pull --rebase``` in your local repo to safely update it

Dev Setup:
- Setup the stuff for React Native (like NodeJS, NPM, etc)
- To run the server go the the ```Eat_and_Greet``` folder and then run ```npx expo start```
    - If you want to run a local emulation:
        - ```npm run android```
        - ```npm run ios``` (MacOS only)
- To view the app server you can create a local emulation of the phone or download Expo Go and scan the QR code in the terminal
